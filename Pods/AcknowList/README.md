## Installation

### CocoaPods

1. Add `pod 'AcknowList'` to your `Podfile`.
2. Run `pod install`.
3. Add the `Pods-#target#-acknowledgements.plist` file generated by CocoaPods to your main target: drag and drop the file from the `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-#target#/` folder in your Xcode project (don‚Äôt copy the file, leave `Copy items if needed` unchecked).

### Swift Package Manager

AcknowList can be installed with the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) (requires Xcode 12 for localized resources).

1. Click on `File` ‚Üí `Swift Packages` ‚Üí `Add Package Dependency‚Ä¶`.
2. Enter `https://github.com/vtourraine/AcknowList`.
3. Select the version you‚Äôd like to use.

## Initialization

The `AcknowListViewController` instance is usually pushed to an existing `UINavigationController`.

``` swift
let viewController = AcknowListViewController()
navigationController.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
```

By default, the controller will try to guess the name of your `.plist` file, based on the bundle name (`Pods-#bundle-name#-acknowledgements.plist`). If that doesn‚Äôt match the file you‚Äôre looking for, you can initialize the view controller with a custom file name or path.

``` swift
let viewController = AcknowListViewController(fileNamed: "Pods-AcknowExample-acknowledgements")
```

``` swift
let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "Pods-AcknowExample-acknowledgements", ofType: "plist")
let viewController = AcknowListViewController(plistPath: path)
```

If you want to include licenses that are not part of a `.plist` file, you can create new `Acknow` instances, and use them for the acknowledgements array of the controller.

``` swift
let acknow = Acknow(title: "...", text: "...")
let viewController = AcknowListViewController(acknowledgements: [acknow])
```

## Customization

The controller can also display a header and a footer. By default, they are loaded from the generated `plist` file, but you can also directly change the properties values.

``` swift
viewController.headerText = "We love open source software."
viewController.footerText = "Powered by CocoaPods.org"
```

The controller title is a localized value for ‚Äúacknowledgements‚Äù. You might want to use this localized value for the button presenting the controller.

``` swift
button.setTitle(AcknowLocalization.localizedTitle(), for: .normal)
```

By default, `AcknowListViewController` uses the ‚Äúgrouped‚Äù table view style. You can choose a different style:

``` swift
let viewController = AcknowListViewController(plistPath: path, style: .plain)
```

If you need to further customize the appearance or behavior of this library, feel free to subclass its classes.

## SwiftUI

AcknowList now offers a SwiftUI interface, which supports all the major platforms.

Instantiate a `AcknowListSwiftUIView` with a path to the `plist` file, or with an array of `Acknow` instances, and present this view from a `NavigationView`.

## Platforms

| Platform | UIKit | SwiftUI |
|:--|:--|:--|
| üì± | iOS 9.0+ | iOS 13.0+ |
| üì∫ | tvOS 9.0+ | tvOS 13.0+ |
| ‚åöÔ∏è | *not supported* | watchOS 7.0+ |
| üíª | *not supported* | macOS 10.15+ |

‚ö†Ô∏è If you install AcknowList with CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager, it will require iOS 13 and tvOS 13. To support earlier versions, please import this library manually, and ignore the SwiftUI classes. Alternatively, use [VTAcknowledgementsViewController](https://github.com/vtourraine/VTAcknowledgementsViewController) instead.

## Requirements
